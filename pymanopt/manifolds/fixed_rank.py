class FixedRankEmbedded(EuclideanEmbeddedSubmanifold):
    r"""Manifold of fixed rank matrices.

    Args:
        m: The number of rows of the matrices in the ambient space.
        n: The number of columns of the matrices.
        k: The rank of the matrices on the manifold.

    Notes:
        * The implementation follows the embedded geometry described in
          [Van2013]_.
        * The class is currently not compatible with the
          :class:`pymanopt.solvers.TrustRegions` solver.

    Manifold of ``m x n`` real matrices of fixed rank ``k``.
    For efficiency purposes, Pymanopt does not represent points on this
    manifold explicitly using ``m x n`` matrices, but instead implicitly using
    a truncated singular value decomposition.
    Specifically, a point is represented by a tuple ``(u, s, vt)`` of three
    numpy arrays.
    The arrays ``u``, ``s`` and ``vt`` have shapes ``(m, k)``, ``(k,)`` and
    ``(k, n)``, respectively, and the low rank matrix which they represent can
    be recovered by the matrix product ``u * diag(s) * vt``.

    For example, to optimize over the space of 5 x 4 matrices with rank 3, we

    would need to

    >>> import pymanopt.manifolds
    >>> manifold = pymanopt.manifolds.FixedRankEmbedded(5, 4, 3)

    Then the shapes will be as follows:

    >>> u, s, vt = manifold.rand()
    >>> u.shape
    (5, 3)
    >>> s.shape
    (3,)
    >>> vt.shape
    (3, 4)

    and the full matrix can be recovered using the matrix product
    ``u @ diag(s) @ vt``:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = u @ np.diag(s) @ vt

    Tangent vectors are represented as a tuple ``(Up, M, Vp)``.
    The matrices ``Up`` (of size ``m x k``) and ``Vp`` (of size ``n x k``) obey
    ``Up' * U = 0 and Vp' * V = 0``.
    The matrix ``M`` (of size ``k x k``) is arbitrary.
    Such a structure corresponds to the
    following tangent vector in the ambient space of ``m x n`` matrices: ``Z =
    U * M * V' + Up * V' + U * Vp'``
    where ``(U, S, V)`` is the current point and ``(Up, M, Vp)`` is the tangent
    vector at that point.

    Vectors in the ambient space are best represented as ``m x n`` matrices.
    If these are low-rank, they may also be represented as structures with
    ``U, S, V`` fields, such that ``Z = U * S * V'``.
    There are no restrictions on what ``U``, ``S`` and ``V`` are, as long as
    their product as indicated yields a real ``m x n`` matrix.

    The chosen geometry yields a Riemannian submanifold of the embedding
    space :math:`\R^(m \times n)` equipped with the usual trace (Frobenius)
    inner product.
