    A point X on the manifold is parameterized as YY^T where Y is a matrix of
    size nxk. As such, X is symmetric, positive semidefinite. We restrict to
    full-rank Y's, such that X has rank exactly k. The point X is numerically
    represented by Y (this is more efficient than working with X, which may
    be big). Tangent vectors are represented as matrices of the same size as
    Y, call them Ydot, so that Xdot = Y Ydot' + Ydot Y. The metric is the
    canonical Euclidean metric on Y.

    Since for any orthogonal Q of size k, it holds that (YQ)(YQ)' = YY',
    we "group" all matrices of the form YQ in an equivalence class. The set
    of equivalence classes is a Riemannian quotient manifold, implemented
    here.

    Notice that this manifold is not complete: if optimization leads Y to be
    rank-deficient, the geometry will break down. Hence, this geometry should
    only be used if it is expected that the points of interest will have rank
    exactly k. Reduce k if that is not the case.

    An alternative, complete, geometry for positive semidefinite matrices of
    rank k is described in Bonnabel and Sepulchre 2009, "Riemannian Metric
    and Geometric Mean for Positive Semidefinite Matrices of Fixed Rank",
    SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications.

    A point X on the manifold M is parameterized as YY^*, where Y is a
    complex matrix of size nxk of full rank. For any point Y on the manifold M,
    given any kxk complex unitary matrix U, we say Y*U  is equivalent to Y,

    classes and is a Riemannian quotient manifold C^{nk}/U(k)

    The metric is the usual real-trace inner product, that is,
    it is the usual metric for the complex plane identified with R^2.

    A point X on the manifold is parameterized as YY^T where Y is a matrix of

    full-rank Y's, such that X has rank exactly k. The point X is numerically

    metric is the canonical Euclidean metric on Y.

    The diagonal constraints on X (X(i, i) == 1 for all i) translate to
    unit-norm constraints on the rows of Y: norm(Y(i, :)) == 1 for all i.  The
    set of such Y's forms the oblique manifold. But because for any orthogonal
    Q of size k, it holds that (YQ)(YQ)' = YY', we "group" all matrices of the
    form YQ in an equivalence class. The set of equivalence classes is a
    Riemannian quotient manifold, implemented here.

    Note that this geometry formally breaks down at rank-deficient Y's.  This
    does not appear to be a major issue in practice when optimization
    algorithms converge to rank-deficient Y's, but convergence theorems no
    longer hold. As an alternative, you may use the oblique manifold (it has
    larger dimension, but does not break down at rank drop.)
